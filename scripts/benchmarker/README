A bunch of scripts to test series of cparser/libfirm commits. This is totally
unsupported and probably won't work out of the box. Some informations:

doall.sh     Perform all steps necessary to measure latest commits
revs.sh      creates a list of libfirm/cparser revision pairs, put output into revs.txt
go.py        benchmarks revisions in revs.txt
extract2.py  Scans the result directory and produces json data. Put into data.js
cparser_benchmarks.html  d3js based visualisation of the results in data.js
