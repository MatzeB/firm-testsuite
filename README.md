# LibFirms C Testsuite

Lots of small C programs testing various parts of our C compiler.

Usually, you just want to execute

    ./makereport

The result is printed on screen and also written to the reports/ directory.
For more documentation look at the makereport help.

    ./makereport -h

You can configure things like the c compiler, parallelism, or special CFLAGS.
